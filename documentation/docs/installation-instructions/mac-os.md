# Installation On macOS

Here is a quick guide to installing VS Code on macOS.

## System Requirements

VS Code requires that you have a computer with a macOS version 11.0 or newer. Additionally you must have at least a 1.6 GHz processor and a minimum of 1 GB of RAM. It will run smoothly on virtually any modern Mac.

## Installation

1. Download the [VS Code app](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=534106) for macOS.

2. Locate the downloaded file (can access this from the browsers recent download list).

_**Note:** If it is a `.zip` file, extract it to get the `.app` file._

3. Drag the `.app` file to your **Applications** folder.

4. VS Code should now show up in your app launcher.

5. Double click the icon to open VS Code.

6. Follow the setup guide to configure the app.

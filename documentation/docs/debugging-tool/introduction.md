# Debugging Tool Introduction

Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors (bugs) in your program. One of the most powerful aspects of a good programmer is being able to debug easily. A lot of programmers choose different methods of debugging, a very common one is using ```print()``` statements throught the program to see which path their current input values are taking. While this works on a small scale, using the built in debugging tool that VSCode provides, you can easily test and build your programs to be bug free!

## What the debug tool is

The VSCode debugger is an interactive interface that lets you see into the "mind" of your program, as you follow through its excecution. On a general level, the VSCode debugger allows you to:
- **Pause** the excecution of your code at a certian point
- **Inspect** all of the current variables, call stacks
- **Watch** and evaluate expressions interactively
- **Slowly walk** through your code one step at a time.

This helps you to **Find logic errors**, understand the flow of your program, and find all your bugs faster, especially when working with more complex projects.

## Where to find it
To use the debugging tool, you must start your program using a different button the run button.

- Open the file to debug, and click on the ```Run and Debug``` button located on the **Left Sidebar**.

Or by using ```Ctrl + Shift + D``` (windows/linux) or ```Cmd + Shift + D```(mac).

This will open up the debugger interface, and your ready to start using the tool.

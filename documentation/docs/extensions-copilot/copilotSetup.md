# Copilot Setup in VS Code

Copilot is a GitHub AI that can be used directly from within VS Code. A subscription is needed before this can be implemented. If you do not have a Copilot subscription, a free plan will be given.

## Initial setup

1. The first thing you'll want to do is hover over the Copilot icon in the Status Bar found in the bottom right corner to the left of the bell icon and select **Set up Copilot**. The Copilot icon is highlighted in red and the **Set up Copilot** button will be in bright blue above it as demonstrated below.

1. Utilizing the account you have for your GitHub Copilot subscription, choose the appropriate sign-in method and follow any prompts provided to you. If, at this point, you do not have a subscription, you will be signed up for the *Copilot Free plan* with the account you sign in with.
1. From there, you will be able to use Copilot in VS Code. You can learn basics in the [Chat](docs/extensions-copilot/copilotChat.md) page and you can learn different adjustments you can make in the [Customization](docs/extensions-copilot/copilotCustomize.md) page.

## Switching accounts

If you have a Copilot subscription associated with another GitHub account, you will need to sign out  of your existing account in VS Code and sign in with the account you'd prefer to use.

1. In the Activity Bar found on the left side of the screen, click the Accounts menu found in the bottom above the gear icon. Go to the account you're currently signed in with, and click **Sign Out** as demonstrated in the following photo.

1. Sign into the GitHub account that you want to use either by following the same steps as above OR going back to the Accounts Menu and select the *Sign in with GitHub to use GitHub Copilot* option.

## Disabling AI features from VS Code

If you would prefer to disable the built-in AI features that AI has, go to the Activity Bar found on the left hand side of the screen and click the Manage menu (gear icon) found in the bottom left corner. Enter the *Settings* menu and either type "Disable AI Features" into the search bar or scroll down to Features > Chat > Disable AI Features. Select the box next to the feature name. This disables and hides chat features and inline suggestions.

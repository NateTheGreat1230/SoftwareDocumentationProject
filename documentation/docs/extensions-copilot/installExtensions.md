# Installing VS Code Extensions

VS Code extensions allow you to add languages, debuggers, tools, and other customized features to support you as you write code. You can install these extensions directly with VS Code or from the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode) with further instructions found later on the page. You can also take advantage of automatic updates to these extensions to always have the latest features. Thousands of extensions with a wide range of categories are available on the Visual Studio Marketplace with a wide range of mechanisms to ensure that no malicious software gets to your machine.

## Browsing Extensions

Visual Studio Marketplace can be found by going directly to their [website](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode) or by opening up the Extensions view directly in VS Code.

1. Open the Extensions view by selecting the Extensions icon, the icon with three squares and a diamond, near the top left side of the screen. You can also use the `Ctrl+Shift+X` keyboard shortcut on Windows or `Cmd+Shift+X` on Mac.
1. In the menu that opens up, type the name of the extension you're searching for into the search bar at the top. If you would like, click the filter button on the right side of the search bar to filter extensions in your search.

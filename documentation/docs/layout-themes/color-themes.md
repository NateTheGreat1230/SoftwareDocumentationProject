# Color Themes

Color themes allow you to change the appearance of VS Code.

## Selecting a Color Theme

To change your current theme:

1. Open the **Command Palette** (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and run `Preferences: Color Theme`.
2. Use the **Up** and **Down** arrow keys to preview available themes.
3. Press **Enter** to confirm your choice.

This saves the theme for your active [profile](introduction.md#profiles).

## Marketplace Introduction

VS Code includes several built-in themes, but you can find many more in the **VS Code Marketplace**.

_**Note:** click to find more information on the [VS Code Extension Marketplace](docs/extensions-copilot/installExtensions.md)._

To browse available themes:

- Open the **Command Palette** (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and run `Preferences: Browse Color Themes in Marketplace`.
- Open the **Extensions view** and search using the filter `@category:"themes"`.

When you find a theme you like, select **Install**, and it will appear in your Color Theme list for the active [profile](introduction.md#profiles).
